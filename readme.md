# Selector Translation

An exercise in understanding how selectors work by translating them to plain English.

### Setup

You do _not_ have to fork this project, since you will not be changing the code, but it is useful to clone it down so that you can play with the code locally.

### Instructions

1. Clone down this repository. You do **not** have to fork it, since we won't be turning in a copy of the code.
2. Open styles/styles.css in VS Code.
3. Read through the code, looking at selectors.
4. For each of the first **10** selectors, write **in your own words** what the selector means. You can write this anywhere you'd like.
5. If you can't figure out what elements a selector is affecting, try adding (then deleting) a border in the rules for that selector.
6. You can check your explanation using the [Selectors Explained](https://kittygiraudel.github.io/selectors-explained/) tool, but give it a try **in your own words** first!
7. We'll turn in this exercise in Canvas by **copying and pasting our explanations into a submission box**.
